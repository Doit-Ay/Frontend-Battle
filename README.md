### Step-by-Step Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and install all necessary dependencies.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Choose one of the following methods to clone the project repository:

    * **HTTPS:**
        ```sh
        git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nexus-dynamics.git](https://github.com/your-username/nexus-dynamics.git)
        ```
    * **SSH:**
        ```sh
        git clone git@github.com:your-username/nexus-dynamics.git
        ```
    Navigate into the newly created project directory:
    ```sh
    cd nexus-dynamics
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    You can use either `npm` or `yarn` to install the project dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

    * **Using npm:**
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * **Using yarn:**
        ```sh
        yarn install
        ```

3.  **Start the Development Server**
    Once the dependencies are installed, start the local development server.

    * **With npm:**
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    * **With yarn:**
        ```sh
        yarn start
        ```
    * **Output Example:** After running the command, you should see output similar to this in your terminal, indicating that the server is running successfully.
        ```
        ‚úî Compiled successfully.

        You can now view nexus-dynamics in the browser.

          Local:            http://localhost:3000
          On Your Network:  [http://192.168.1.10:3000](http://192.168.1.10:3000)

        Note that the development build is not optimized.
        To create a production build, use yarn build.
        ```

4.  **Access in Browser**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL to see the application live:
    [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000)

## üöÄ Available Scripts

This project comes with a set of predefined npm/yarn scripts to streamline the development process.

| Command         | Description                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`     | Starts the development server with hot-reloading at `http://localhost:3000`. |
| `npm run build` | Bundles the app into static files for production in the `build` folder.      |
| `npm test`      | Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.                          |
| `npm run lint`  | Lints the code to check for style and syntax errors.                         |
| `npm run eject` | Removes the single build dependency from your project (use with caution).    |

**Development Workflow Guidance:**
* Use `npm start` for your day-to-day development.
* Run `npm test` frequently to ensure your changes haven't broken existing functionality.
* Before committing your code, run `npm run lint` to check for code quality issues.
* When you are ready to deploy, create a production-ready build with `npm run build`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

Key configuration files in this project allow for extensive customization.

* **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
* **`tailwind.config.js` / `craco.config.js` (if applicable)**: Explains how to customize UI frameworks or build processes. For example, to add a new color to Tailwind CSS:
    ```javascript
    // tailwind.config.js
    module.exports = {
      theme: {
        extend: {
          colors: {
            'custom-blue': '#243c5a',
          },
        },
      },
    };
    ```
* **`.env`**: Store environment variables here. For example, an API key. Create a `.env.local` file for local overrides.
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

**How to Modify Settings:**
To customize the project, modify the values in these files. For instance, to change the browser port, you might modify the `start` script in `package.json` or create an `.env` file with `PORT=3001`.

## üîß Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are solutions to common problems.

* **Port Conflicts**
    * **Issue**: The development server fails to start because port 3000 is already in use.
    * **Solution**: Start the server on a different port. The script will often prompt you to use the next available port automatically. Alternatively, you can specify a port in your `.env` file: `PORT=3001`.

* **Dependency Problems**
    * **Issue**: `npm install` fails or you encounter errors related to missing modules.
    * **Solution**:
        1.  Delete the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) file.
            ```sh
            rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
            ```
        2.  Clear the npm cache.
            ```sh
            npm cache clean --force
            ```
        3.  Re-install dependencies.
            ```sh
            npm install
            ```

* **Build Errors**
    * **Issue**: `npm run build` fails with errors.
    * **Solution**: Check the terminal output for specific error messages. Common causes include syntax errors, type mismatches (if using TypeScript), or incorrect import paths.

* **Getting Help**
    If you're still stuck, you can:
    * Check the project's **Issues** tab on GitHub.
    * Create a new issue, providing detailed information about the problem and steps to reproduce it.
